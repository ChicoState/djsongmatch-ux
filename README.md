# DJ Song Match

<!-- !!!Brief introduction to the project and the problem it is intended to solve!!! -->

DJ Song Match is software created to improve the process of finding compatible songs. Similar software are blocked behind paywalls and lack useful features such as contrasting genres. DJ Song Match will both be free and open source and provide song analysis features that other programs do not have.

# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

**Executive Summary**

Initial research and design concentrated on how DJ Song Match will improve the experience of discovering and analyzing compatible songs.

- Competitive analysis revealed opportunities to **challenge industry norms** by differentiating themselves from the competition:
  - Dedicated DJ Software: Customers displeased with current **fees and subscriptions** needed for DJ mixing software.
  - Music Streaming Services: Lacks **user control** of song characteristics and features to **smoothly transition** between songs.
  - Manual Sorting: Requires extensive **effort and time**. Affected by **personal biases**.
  <!-- - Unsatisfactory Graphical User Interfaces: **Cluttered and confusing** app interactions make navigating apps frustrating. -->
- Heuristic evaluation highlighted effective design patterns and areas that could be improved upon:
  - **Keyboard shortcuts** and **advanced settings** could improve **efficiency** for experienced power-users.
  - Generating matches lacks user **input** and **control**
- Personas and scenarios identified user experience needs:
  - **Beginner-friendly** interface for inexperienced artists
  - Easier song matching on **mobile** without the need for a **desktop computer**
  - Methods to **filter explicit** songs from recommendations
- Sketches and diagrams demonstrate interface features:
  - Loading page for **showing progress** during long computations
  - **Showing/Hiding** configuration menu to **reduce visual clutter**
  - **Manipulation** and **organization** of songs and playlists

# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

**Executive Summary**

Formative evaluations and outside input used in order to refine the layout, improve the user experience, and add additional options for how DJ Song Match finds compatible songs.

- Informal feedback from audience given the question "What characteristics would you care about most in the recommendation algorithm?" granted insight into **additional desired filters**:
  - Method of selecting a **date range** for matching songs.
  - Search for **similar or matching genres** of music.
  - Potential for matching based on **language of lyrics**.
- Figma wireframe created to demonstrate application layout and primary features:
  - Basic filters **easily accessible** with additional, advanced filters hidden in a **pop-up menu**.
  - Search bar can be used to **find specific songs**, or can **match songs** from the current playlist.
  - Table of recommended songs display **tempo**, **key**, and how closely they **match the target song**.
  - Songs in playlist can be easily **reordered** or **removed**; **undo and redo** buttons provided for **user control**.
- Cognitive walkthrough demonstrated flaws in layout to be iterated upon and corrected:
  - Users generally **overwhelmed** or **confused** about how to start - need to **focus their attention** on the search bar as a **call-to-action**.
  - Some buttons deemed **ambiguous** as to their specific functionality.
  - **Clarification** necessary for **song metric terms** such as "danceability" and "liveliness".
  - Demonstration **lacking account page**. Even when added, important to **distinguish** features that **do** and **don't** require an **account**.
  - One user expressed worry about lack of ways to **curate the recommended songs list** or to **play songs in-app**.
