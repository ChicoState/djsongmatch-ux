# DJ Song Match

<!-- !!!Brief introduction to the project and the problem it is intended to solve!!! -->
DJ Song Match is software created to improve the process of finding compatible songs. Similar software are blocked behind paywalls and lack useful features such as contrasting genres. DJ Song Match will both be free and open source and provide song analysis features that other programs do not have.

# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

**Executive Summary**

Initial research and design concentrated on how DJ Song Match will improve the experience of discovering and analyzing compatible songs.
- Competitive analysis revealed opportunities to **challenge industry norms** by differentiating themselves from the competition:
    - Dedicated DJ Software: Customers displeased with current **fees and subscriptions** needed for DJ mixing software.
    - Music Streaming Services: Lacks **user control** of song characteristics and features to **smoothly transition** between songs.
    - Manual Sorting: Requires extensive **effort and time**. Affected by **personal biases**.
    <!-- - Unsatisfactory Graphical User Interfaces: **Cluttered and confusing** app interactions make navigating apps frustrating. -->
