# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

## Introduction

!!! Describe the general problem that the project is trying to solve and the focus of this interval of work !!!

## Methods

Our team utilized **informal feedback** and **cognitive walkthroughs** to gather external insight into our designs.

The informal feedback first involved presenting a working product demonstration to an audience (n=35) of undergraduate software engineering students. During the demonstration, the software engineering team (n=6) executed key tasks within the app to highlight its different features. Following this showcase, the team asked the audience a single question to collect their feedback.

The software engineering and usability teams collaborated to determine which prompt question to present to the audience. Ultimately, we selected a question that would provide insights into requested future functionalities. Specifically, the software engineering team asked, "What characteristics would you care about most in the recommendation algorithm?" This question is especially relevant to us because our app revolves around recommending songs with similar characteristics to users.

<!-- !!! Describe research methods you used to discover new insights, which explains the purpose of each. Provide enough detail that someone would be able to faithfully reproduce your research. Only include research methods in here, not design documents/techniques/artifacts !!! -->

## Findings

Our software engineering team received six responses from the informal feedback.

<!-- !!! For each research method, detail each of the findings to clarify new discoveries of users' needs !!! -->

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!
