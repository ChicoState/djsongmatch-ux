# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

## Introduction

!!! Describe the general problem that the project is trying to solve and the focus of this interval of work !!!

## Methods

<!-- !!! Describe research methods you used to discover new insights, which explains the purpose of each. Provide enough detail that someone would be able to faithfully reproduce your research. Only include research methods in here, not design documents/techniques/artifacts !!! -->

Our team utilized **informal feedback** and **cognitive walkthroughs** to gather external insight into our designs.

The informal feedback first involved presenting a working product demonstration to an audience (n=35) of undergraduate software engineering students. During the demonstration, our software engineering team (n=6) executed key tasks within the app to highlight its different features. Following this showcase, our team asked the audience a single question to collect feedback.

Our software engineering and usability teams collaborated to determine which prompt question to present to the audience. Ultimately, we selected a question that would provide insights into requested future functionalities. Specifically, our software engineering team asked, "What characteristics would you care about most in the recommendation algorithm?" This question is especially relevant to us because our app revolves around recommending songs with similar characteristics to users.

Our team also conducted cognitive walkthroughs to receive qualitative feedback about the usability of our wireframes. First, our team submitted completed drafts for our wireframes in the communication platform Slack. Each team in the Slack discussion group (n=30) submitted wireframes, personas, and scenarios for review. The professor overseeing all the teams tasked each team with performing cognitive walkthroughs for two other apps. Therefore, the testers involved in the cognitive walkthrough for our app voluntarily provided their feedback, and our team did not choose which people would perform the cognitive walkthroughs.

In the posting for our cognitive walkthrough request, our team provided four personas that testers could use to contextualize their cognitive walkthroughs. Each persona had one scenario associated with them. Testers chose the persona and scenario that interested them the most. Each tester then assumed the role of the persona they chose and navigated through our wireframes aiming to complete the goal of the associated scenario.

At each step of completing the goal, testers noted which actions they took, describing whether their persona would understand what to do at each step and whether they could confirm that they made progress towards completing their goal.

Following each simulated persona's attempt to complete the designated goal, regardless of whether they succeeded or discontinued the process, the testers would reply to our posting in Slack with the notes they compiled during the cognitive walkthrough.

Our app received four cognitive walkthroughs that simulated three unique personas and scenarios. The testers did not provide solutions to their difficulties during their cognitive walkthrough. Instead, our usability team analyzed the confusion or satisfaction testers noted at each step and identified potential changes we could introduce to our wireframes to address these difficulties.

## Findings

Our software engineering team received six responses from the informal feedback. The first respondent asked for a locking mechanism for categories to receive consistent recommendations. The second respondent requested our app to incorporate genre similarity into our recommendation algorithm.

The informal feedback also provided the novel consideration of including a filter for ranges of release dates of songs. Moreover, another audience member requested a language filter to ensure users could receive recommendations in a common language. Finally, the last respondent concluded that our app lacked support for creating a queue of apps that tracks which songs the user wished to preserve.

Results from the cognitive walkthroughs identified areas of confusion in our app. One tester noted that the search bar to select a song did not signal a large enough call for action. The search bar's visual design suggests that its purpose is to query for information rather than being the core first step of using our app.

Another tester noted that our choice to initially populate our recommendation table with the words "No matching songs" created confusion for the user upon first entering the app. They also highlighted the ambiguity of different functionality in our app. The "Export" button does not provide enough information about what, where, or how our app exports information. The Plus and Minus buttons are ambiguous in how they will affect each list of songs. Finally, the user's confusion around how our app defined song metrics like "Liveliness" and "Loudness" indicated that our app did not provide sufficient context and clarification to support their understanding.

<!-- !!! For each research method, detail each of the findings to clarify new discoveries of users' needs !!! -->

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

The limited diversity of audience members restricted the depth of our informal feedback. We presented our demonstration and questions to a classroom of undergraduate software engineering students. As such, many respondents had above-average technical ability. Because of this, their feedback could potentially overlook introductory features that would be helpful for less adept users.

<!-- !!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!! -->
