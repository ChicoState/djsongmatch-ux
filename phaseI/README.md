# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

## Introduction

Current software does not provide free tools to recommend musically-compatible songs in an efficient manner. The first phase of this project will prioritize providing a simple user interface that is could efficiently be navigated. Key features of the app will include matching songs based on the metrics of tonal key and tempo.

## Methods

In order to better understand the current state of song matching and analysis software, DJ Song Match's user experience team (n=2) conducted competitive analysis on other software providers and heuristic evaluations on competitors in the same field.

We compiled a list of competitors by utilizing search engines to query for DJ analysis apps. To gather further data, our team scoured through online forums such as Reddit comment sections to discover users' recommended apps and their experience of them.

After gathering a list of competitors, our team performed competitive analysis by inspecting their respective websites to understand their pricing model, feature list, and user interface.

Finally, our team completed a heuristic evaluation on one particular competitor, Sort by Tune, by utilizing Jakob Nielsen's 10 general principles for interactive design. Each member of the team personally interacted with Sort by Tune and provided a score and summary of how closely the web app aligned with Nielsen's principles.

Following the individual evaluations, our team gathered together in person and verbally shared our reasons for providing a heuristic a particular score. After deliberation between team members, we consolidated our individual findings into a unified heuristic evaluation that highlighted key usability strengths of weaknesses of the app.

## Findings

Competitive Analysis:
  - Many apps dedicated to analyzing and matching songs require paid subscriptions, which could be a sticking point for many users.
  - Baseline features that these apps provide include song analysis based on BPM, key, energy, and harmonics (often used to determine genre), and manual adjustments to song ordering. Local audio file support is usually provided.
  - Of the higher-end apps, learnability could be a problem. User interfaces were cluttered and difficult to navigate.
  - Almost all applications were PC-exclusive.
  - Hand-sorting is always an option for users that have enough time or who don't find the benefits provided by dedicated applications to be worth their cost.

Heuristic Evaluation of Sort By Tune:
  - Its greatest strength was its overall learnability, providing useful documentation and having very a very organized layout.
  - Uses consistent wording and helpful visuals to indicate the overall status of the sorted playlist.
  - Fully reliant on Spotify as a database, limiting its use to organizing Spotify playlists.
  - Lacks any kind of shortcuts for advanced users.

## Conclusions

From the competitive analysis, we learned that the realm of song matching and analysis is lacking in free alternatives, and that even most of the paid options are difficult for new users to get into. There is also a potential market opportunity for a music matching app that works on mobile devices, something worth considering for future expansions. We can be likely be expected to implement many of the same basic matching principles as our competitors, and having the option for performing song analysis on local files would give us an advantage over the few apps that don't have that option.

From the heuristic evaluation, we learned how one such application both succeeded and failed to provide users with a satisfactory option to find musically-compatible songs. While Sort By Tune provides an excellent user interface and options for playlist sorting, it is limited to its dependence on the Spotify database, requiring both a Spotify account and pre-existing Spotify playlists. From this, we can see how the ability to pull songs from other databases as well as the user's own library would be a valuable feature to expand our app's versatility. Sort By Tune also lacks further options for long-time users, such as keyboard shortcuts or saving song matching presets for later use.

## Caveats

An important factor that has limited our research is that nobody on our team has experience working as a DJ, and don't know what industry standards are. As such, a large portion of our analysis comes from the standpoint for casual users who simply have an interest in music.
!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!
