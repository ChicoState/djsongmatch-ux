# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

## Introduction

Current software does not provide free tools to recommend musically-compatible songs in an efficient manner. The first phase of this project will prioritize providing a simple user interface that is could efficiently be navigated. Key features of the app will include matching songs based on the metrics of tonal key and tempo.

## Methods

In order to better understand the current state of song matching and analysis software, DJ Song Match's user experience team (n=2) conducted competitive analysis on other software providers and heuristic evaluations on competitors in the same field.

We compiled a list of competitors by utilizing search engines to query for DJ analysis apps. Further, our team scoured through online forums such as Reddit comment sections to discover users' recommended apps and their experience of them.

After gathering a list of competitors, our team performed competitive analysis by inspecting their respective websites to understand their pricing model, feature list, and user interface.

Finally, our team completed a heuristic evaluation on one particular competitor, Sort by Tune by utilizing Jakob Nielsen's 10 general principles for interactive design. Each member of the team personally interacted with Sort by Tune and provided a score and summary of how closely the web app aligned with Nielsen's principles.

Following the individual evaluations, our team gathered together in person and verbally shared our reasons for providing a heuristic a particular score. After deliberation between team members, we consolidated our individual findings into a unified heuristic evaluation that highlighted key usability strengths of weaknesses of the app.

## Findings

!!! For each research method, detail each of the findings to clarify new discoveries of users' needs !!!

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!
